# Greatly Accessible Styling
(css that's actually gas)

features
- [x] mixins
- [x] better variables
- [ ] nested classes
- [x] parameters for classes

i made this since i actually dislike tailwind. i think that regular css is really great but there are some features that it's lacking to become a fully fleshed out language that feels fun and nice to use. preproccesors like SCSS already exist but they 

how to use
1. `npm install greatly-accessible-styling`
2. `gas <input.gas> <input.html> -o <output.css>`
